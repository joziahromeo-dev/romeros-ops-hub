# ROMERO’S Ops Hub

**Plan the week. Track the paperwork. Get paid faster.**

ROMERO’S Ops Hub is an Android-first operations management platform built for owner-operators and small trucking fleets who want structure, clarity, and control over their business.

## What Exists Today (MVP)
- Weekly Run Planner (lanes, RPM targets, hours, home time)
- Load folders with secure document storage (Rate Cons, BOLs, PODs, receipts)
- Paperwork status checklist per load
- Simple invoice tracking (paid, unpaid, overdue, follow-up)
- Dashboard for daily priorities and operational visibility

---

## What We’re Actively Building
- Cashflow follow-up workflows
- Broker performance notes
- Standardized request/ticket system
- Templates for detention, TONU, and payment follow-ups

## Operating Systems Philosophy

ROMERO’S Ops Hub is designed around **operating systems**, not scattered tools.

Current and planned systems include:

- **Ops Hub Core** — loads, documents, invoices, and checklists
- **COS (Cashflow Operating System)** — collections, follow-ups, and pay-speed tracking
- **DOS (Decision Operating System)** — capturing operational decisions and outcomes
- **ROS (Risk Optimization System)** — identifying broker, lane, and cashflow risk
- **PLOS (Profit & Load Optimization System)** — improving load selection and weekly outcomes

These systems start rule-based and analytics-driven, with a long-term path toward predictive optimization.

---

## Roadmap (High Level)
- Phase 1: Operational structure and visibility
- Phase 2: Cashflow optimization and workflow standardization
- Phase 3: Decision analytics and performance insights
- Phase 4: Predictive and optimization features (data-dependent)

---

## Tech Stack
- React Native (Expo)
- Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage)
- Android-first (iOS planned)
