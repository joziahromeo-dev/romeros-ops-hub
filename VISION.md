# VISION — ROMERO’S Ops Hub

This document describes the long-term vision and strategic roadmap for ROMERO’S Ops Hub.

**Important:** This file contains goals and future ideas. It is not a promise of current features.
The README describes what exists today.

## Why this product exists

Owner-operators and small fleets lose money and time because operations are fragmented:
- planning lives in texts/notes
- paperwork lives in photos/email
- invoicing lives in spreadsheets
- follow-up happens too late

ROMERO’S Ops Hub turns operations into a repeatable system:
**Plan the week. Track the paperwork. Get paid faster.**

## Operating Systems (the platform philosophy)

The platform is designed around operating systems, not scattered tools:

- **Ops Hub Core** — loads, documents, invoices, and checklists  
- **COS (Cashflow Operating System)** — collections workflows, follow-ups, pay-speed tracking  
- **DOS (Decision Operating System)** — capturing operational decisions + outcomes (training-data foundation)  
- **ROS (Risk Optimization System)** — identifying broker, lane, and cashflow risk  
- **PLOS (Profit & Load Optimization System)** — improving load selection and weekly outcomes  

The goal is to start rule-based and analytics-driven, then evolve into predictive optimization *only when the data supports it*.

## AGOS integration (Operations-first variant)

AGOS (Audience Growth Operating System) is primarily a growth framework, but an operations-first variant can be used to improve client operations and retention:

- **Message clarity**: what we do + what results clients get  
- **Distribution**: how clients adopt the system (weekly rhythm + templates + requests)  
- **Operating rhythm**: weekly review, decisions, follow-ups  
- **Measurement**: cashflow, paperwork completeness, on-time collections  

AGOS is optional and should not block the MVP.

## ML / AI roadmap (data-dependent)

We will not label the product “AI-powered” until models are validated and deliver measurable value.

### Phase 0 — ML-ready design (now)
- capture decisions, context, and outcomes
- normalize data (timestamps, IDs, status changes)
- build reliable workflows first

### Phase 1 — Descriptive analytics
- dashboards: pay speed, overdue rates, paperwork completeness
- trends by broker, lane, week

### Phase 2 — Predictive heuristics (rules + statistics)
- risk flags: high-risk broker, low-margin lanes
- recommended follow-up cadence based on past behavior

### Phase 3 — Classical ML models
- predict payment delays (days)
- predict likelihood of detention/TONU approval
- predict week outcome vs target (revenue, miles, home time)

### Phase 4 — Optimization / recommendations
- load selection recommendations based on constraints
- cashflow optimization strategies
- risk-adjusted planning guidance

## Economic development / growth flow (business model)

The business model is subscription-based with optional services:

- Starter / Pro / Fleet tiers
- optional “done-with-you” setup call
- future: templates packs, fleet analytics, integrations (TMS, factoring, accounting)

---

## Guardrails (so we build the right way)

- MVP first: workflows that create order and reduce chaos
- only add AI when data is strong and outcomes are measurable
- keep claims honest: separate **current features** (README) from **future vision** (this file)
- privacy and security by design (auth + row-level security + least privilege)

---

## Long-term goal

Build the operations platform that:
- helps small fleets run like disciplined businesses
- improves cashflow and reduces late pay
- creates the data foundation for decision intelligence and optimization
